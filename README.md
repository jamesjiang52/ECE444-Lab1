## Activity 5
I committed c1 and c2 to the rebase branch:
![rebase_head](docs/images/rebase_head.PNG)

Then committed c3 and c4 to the develop branch:
![develop_head](docs/images/develop_head.PNG)

I ran an interactive rebase command on the rebase branch, which opened up this text editor window:
![interactive_rebase](docs/images/interactive_rebase.PNG)

There were a number of merge conflicts (because the commits all changed the same lines); this is the entire output of the rebase command:
![output_rebase](docs/images/output_rebase.PNG)

Commits c3 and c4 show up in the history of the rebase branch now:
![rebase_head_after_rebase](docs/images/rebase_head_after_rebase.PNG)
